	  Using the lab signup command!
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Here is an example usage of the command:
	</p>
	<p>
	We start by simply running cs033_lab_signups: 
	</p>
	<code>
	$ cs033_lab_signups
	</code>

	<p>
	We are greeted with the following output:
	</p>
	<code>
	  Welcome to cs33! Please list (space-separated) all the labs you can make from the following list: <br />
	  Lab 1: Monday 4-6<br />
	  Lab 2: Monday 6-8<br />
	  Lab 3: Monday 8-10<br />
	  Lab 4: Monday 10-12<br />
	  Lab 5: Tuesday 7-9<br />
	  Lab 6: Tuesday 9-11<br />

	</code>
	<p>
	  We then type our labs.  This can be in a variety of formats. For the sake of simplicity, let's just list the lab numbers.  I see that I can make any lab on monday, so I type
	</p>
	<code>
	  1 2 3 4
	</code>
	<p>
	  and then press enter.  The output on my screen now looks like this:

  And you're done!  <b> You are only signed up for a lab section if you see a confirmation message.</b>  These are the messages like '<code>signing up for Lab x: Xday x-x</code>' That print out after you have listed your availability.
